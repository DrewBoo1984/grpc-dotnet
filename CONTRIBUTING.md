To fully commit to my achieved goal of living sober, I will:

1. Discard of all drugs and paraphernalia I have in possession.

2. Go to any rehabilitation center inboxed to me via DrewBoo1984@yahoo.com

3.Fully participate in the rehabilitation process that is precribed to me via staff, physicians and any and all lawful regulations staff and physicians ask of me. (I just do not know how to start since my network and phone has limited capabilities.)

4. In need of support be it online or by any other means.
